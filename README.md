## Project Description
The **ICPC HTI Community Platform** is an online learning system designed to enhance problem-solving skills for university students at the Higher Technological Institute (HTI). Built as a collaborative effort by the ICPC HTI Community, this platform offers a variety of programming courses, progress tracking, and administrative tools to streamline educational workflows. It aims to empower students with accessible, high-quality resources while enabling instructors and HR to monitor performance efficiently.

Developed under my leadership as Team Lead, the project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience, supporting over 500 students with 10+ instructional sessions uploaded to date.
